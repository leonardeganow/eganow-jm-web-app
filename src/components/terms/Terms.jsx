            <h1>Campaign Finance Laws</h1>
            <p>
              Political contributions are governed by the laws in Ghana. JM 2024
              Fund Raising Campaign Team makes its best efforts to ensure that
              all contributions made on the JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign
              Project site or channels are in accordance with these laws.
              Nonetheless, you have final responsibility for ensuring your own
              compliance. For example: JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team will
              not permit users to make donations larger than GHS 15,000.00 a day
              to the candidate. However, JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team does
              not track users' contributions through other avenues (e.g.
              fundraisers, candidates' websites). Therefore you (and not JM 2024
              Fund Raising Campaign Team) are responsible for ensuring that your
              total contributions through these different avenues do not exceed
              your limits . If you are in a position to make these kinds of
              large contributions, please be careful and don't give these
              campaigns' accountants or the Project Coordinator any more
              headaches than they already have.

            <h1>Refund policy</h1>
            <p>
              JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team does everything we can to
              accommodate requests for refunds. We do our best to honor refunds
              requested for reasons such as input error, when a contributor
              accidentally donates twice or enters the wrong donation amount. JM
              2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team will not consider refunds for
              other reasons such as a change in political or personal opinion or
              the cancellation of an event. JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team
              reserves the right to refuse a refund request for these or other
              reasons. All refund requests are subject to the availability of
              the contribution funds. Because JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team
              forwards contributions to the candidate, cause, or committee to
              whom you choose to contribute, JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team
              will only refund a contribution if we still have the funds or can
              recover the funds from the recipient. For this reason, it is of
              the utmost importance that you make your request for a refund as
              soon after contributing as possible. All refunds issued by JM 2024
              Fund Raising Campaign Team will be credited back to the card or
              channel used to make the contribution. In all cases where we are
              not able to accommodate a refund request, we will be happy to
              refer you to the recipient of your contribution so that you may
              request a refund directly from them. Our state of the art fraud
              detection software constantly monitors the site for fraudulent
              activity using stolen cards. When our software identifies a
              fraudulent transaction, the contribution will be refunded
              automatically regardless of whether a refund has been requested.
              If you are with a campaign, committee, or organization that has
              received a contribution through JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team
              and would like to request that we refund that contribution, please
              contact us at jmcampaign24@gmail.com or call us on +233243216827
              and we will do our best to assist you.

            <p>
              For your convenience, JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team offers
              the ability to make a recurring contribution to one or more
              recipients using a stored payment method. When you sign up for a
              recurring contribution, JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team will
              charge the amount you designated to your stored account once each
              month and forward that contribution to the recipient you have
              chosen. All payment information is stored securely in our system,
              and we will never change the amount, frequency, or recipient of
              your recurring contribution. If you wish to cancel future
              instances of a recurring contribution, or change the payment
              method used for future charges.

              cash a check from JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team which
              includes your contribution (after JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign
              Team makes repeated attempts to work with the campaign to ensure
              all checks are cashed), or (b) affirmatively refuses a
              contribution earmarked through JM 2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team,
              your contribution will be re-designated as a contribution to JM
              2024 Fund Raising Campaign Team.
