                professions. The Good Governance Card ensures that the voices
                and interests of ordinary Ghanaians and the middle class are

                The initiative seeks to change the perception that political
                participation is distant or exclusive. By involving citizens in
                the campaign funding process, the Good Governance Card sends a
                powerful message that their opinions and contributions matter,
                motivating them to take a more active role in shaping Ghana's
                future.

                When citizens see that their participation and contributions are
